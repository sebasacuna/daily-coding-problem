#### Problem 1

Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

#### Problem 2

Given a list of numbers, that are out of order, determine the bounds of the smallest window that must be sorted in order 
for the entire array to be sorted. For example, given [3, 7, 5, 6, 9], you should return [1,3].
